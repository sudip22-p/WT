<h1>Theory</h1>
<ol>
<li>Normal Flow, or Flow Layout, is the way that Block and Inline elements are displayed on a page before any changes are made to their layout.</li>

<li>The position property specifies the type of positioning method used for an element (static, relative, fixed, absolute or sticky).</li>
<li>Elements are then positioned using the top, bottom, left, and right properties. However, these properties will not work unless the position property is set first. They also work differently depending on the position value.</li>
<li>HTML elements are positioned static by default.Static positioned elements are not affected by the top, bottom, left, and right properties.</li>
<li>An element with position: relative; is positioned relative to its normal position.</li>
<li>An element with position: absolute; is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor.However, if an absolute positioned element has no positioned ancestors, it uses the document body, and moves along with page scrolling.</li>
