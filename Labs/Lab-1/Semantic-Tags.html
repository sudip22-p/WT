            The England cricket team represents England and Wales in
            international cricket. Since 1997, it has been governed by the
            England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB), having been previously
            governed by Marylebone Cricket Club (the MCC) since 1903.[8][9]
            England, as a founding nation, is a Full Member of the International
            Cricket Council (ICC) with Test, One Day International (ODI) and
            Twenty20 International (T20I) status. Until the 1990s, Scottish and
            Irish players also played for England as those countries were not
            yet ICC members in their own right.
          </p>

          <p>
            England and Australia were the first teams to play a Test match
            (15â€“19 March 1877), and along with South Africa, these nations
            formed the Imperial Cricket Conference (the predecessor to today's
            International Cricket Council) on 15 June 1909. England and
            Australia also played the first ODI on 5 January 1971. England's
            first T20I was played on 13 June 2005, once more against Australia.
          </p>

          <p>
            As of 12 December 2022, England have played 1,057 Test matches,
            winning 386 and losing 317 (with 354 draws).[10] In Test series
            against Australia, England play for The Ashes, one of the most
            famous trophies in all of sport, and they have won the urn on 32
            occasions. England have also played 773 ODIs, winning 389.[11] They
            have appeared in the final of the Cricket World Cup four times,
            winning once in 2019; they have also finished as runners-up in two
            ICC Champions Trophies (2004 and 2013). England have played 170
            T20Is, winning 90.[12] They won the ICC T20 World Cup in 2010 and
            2022, and were runners-up in 2016.
